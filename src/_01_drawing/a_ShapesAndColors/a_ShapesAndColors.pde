// 1. Run this empty program 
// The grey square that appears has sides that are 100 pixels long

// 2. Code a size command to make it big enough for your picture

//    The size command looks like this:      
  size (10000,10000);
//    Try putting different numbers in the parentheses.
//    See if you can figure out which number is the width, and which is the height


// 3. Now add an ellipse command to draw a circle. An ellipse is like an oval.

  
 ellipse(250,250, 100,100);

      
rect(220,350, 200,100);

fill(0,250,0);
 
ellipse(350,250,100,100);

noFill();
ellipse(250,250,450,450);
